Code@LTH By-law
===============

For Swedish readers: [*By-law*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/By-law) is the English term for [*stadgar*](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadgar).

Having a by-law is a necessary requirement in order to be able to incorporate a nonprofit organization in Sweden. 
It is intended that the by-law will be publicly available here in English for public display to our members.

It is however not yet written, so check back later!
