Code@LTH Meta Repository
========================

![issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/badges/shields.svg)

*A repository for Code@LTH's (semi-)official documents*

The current only documents living here are:

 - [Manifesto](./manifesto.md), the document that concisely describes out intents/goals and methods.
 - [By-law](./bylaw.md) *(Swedish: stadgar)*, describes the formal rules for our internal process.

The intention of this repository is to create a central hub for all documents central to the organization. 
The version control will help create a living memory of the development of our goals and methods.

It is primarily maintained by Code@LTH's Meta-group, but PRs are welcome!
