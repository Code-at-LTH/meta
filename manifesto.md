Code@LTH Manifesto
==================

### Intent

 - To help build a stronger culture around programming at LTH.
   - By maintaining a community where people can exchange knowledge related to programming.
   - By doing this we become better programmers.
 - To encourage an inspire people to build things.
   - For fun, learning or profit.
 - To encourage development of, and contributions to, free and open source software.
 

### Methods

 - Gathering everyone at and around LTH with an interest in programming in a community.
 - Organizing meetups, lectures and workshops.


### Rules

 - Leave prejudice and bigotry at the door.
 - We are independent of any political party (partipolitiskt obundet).


### Going forward

We are still a very young organization and are unsure of the best methods and their specifics to best fullfill our intents. Since we do not know *how* we will change it is of great importance that this document isn't considered overly authorative and is subject to constant change and revision. We do however hope that this document will try to be short and concise, and should neither be too specific nor too broad.
