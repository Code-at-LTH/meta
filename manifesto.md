Code@LTH Manifesto
==================

### Intent

 - To help build a stronger culture around programming at LTH
 - To maintain a community where people can exchange knowledge related to programming
 - To inspire people to build things alone or together whether for fun, learning, utility or profit
 - To encourage developing and contributing to free and open source software

 
### Methods

 - Gathering everyone at and around LTH with an interest in programming in a community
 - Organizing meetups


### Going forward

We are still a very young organization and are unsure of the best methods and their specifics to best fullfill our intents. Since we do not know *how* we will change it is of great importance that this document isn't considered overly authorative and is subject to constant change and revision. We do however hope that this document will try to be short and concise, and should neither be too specific or too broad.
